Each question stands by itself. For example, if you ask “what topics did Simone de Beauvoir write about”, you cannot follow up by asking “and what is the content of that work” and expect the system to understand what you mean. At this time, you will have to include all relevant information in each question, e.g. “what is the content of Beauvoir’s The Second Sex\"? </p>","How to use the Research Assistant":"How to use the Summon Research Assistant","Research assistant navigation menu":"Summon Research assistant navigation menu","Authenticate in order to access Research Assistant new feature":"Authenticate in order to access Summon Research Assistant new feature","Signed in with %{provider}":null,"How to cite AI-generated content":null};
